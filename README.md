# Undergraduate Final year Thesis

Implemented and verified the fourth order Predictor-Corrector Method for solving two of the widely used partial differential equations in Fluid Dynamics :

1. 2-Dimensional Stagnation Point Flow  (Newtonian Fluid Flow Model)

2. Unsteady Micropolar fluid flow across a stretching/shrinking sheet with thermal radiation (Non-Newtonian/Micropolar Fluid Flow Model)

An exact agreement was reached for implemeting Gear's Method with use from Serth's technique of Orthogonal Collocation to solve Problem 1 after applying the fourth order predictor-corrector.
However, Problem 2 still faces needs a better trial function for implementing Serth's technique to get a close approximation.
